passivedns (1.2.1+git20180201.sdinetH12) stretch; urgency=medium

  * Make logfiles by default only readable by user passivedns, group adm.
  * logrotate: create empty logfile with correct permissions after
    rotate, so that the running daemon is still able to write into it.

passivedns (1.2.1+git20180201.sdinetH11) stretch; urgency=medium

  * Make /etc/init.d/passivedns work correctly with spaces inside the
    /etc/default/passivedns parameters - needed to correctly work with
    custom BPF filter rules.
  * Do not depend on libdate-simple-perl package.
  * Fixed /etc/logrotate.d/passivedns
  * /etc/init.d/passivedns: Create log- and statsfiles if they do not
    exist, and chown them to passivedns so that the daemon is able
    to write into them.
